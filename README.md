# Teaching Samples Portfolio

This repository contains interactive teaching samples created by **Juan Esteban Silva Romero** for the Brilliant.org Producer (AI Tooling) application.

The portfolio includes:
- ðŸ§© **Sample 1: Python Loops â€“ The Loop that Saves You Time**  
  Introduces learners to programming loops in Python using simple, real-world examples.  
  Includes learner Q&A about `range()`, variables, indentation, and syntax highlighting.  

- ðŸ§© **Sample 2: Banking, Percentages, and Probability**  
  Uses a real-world credit card cashback scenario to teach percentages, thresholds, and probability.  
  Includes learner Q&A about equations, thresholds, estimation, and why fees/percentages matter.
